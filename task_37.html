        // WORD BLANKS

        // DESCRIPTION:
        /* In this challenge, we provide you with a noun, a verb, an adjective and an adverb.
           You need to form a complete sentence using words of your choice, along with the words we provide.
           You will need to use the string concatenation operator + to build a new string,
           using the provided variables: myNoun, myAdjective, myVerb, and myAdverb.
           You will then assign the formed string to the wordBlanks variable.
           You should not change the words assigned to the variables.
           You will also need to account for spaces in your string, so that the final sentence has spaces between all the words. The result should be a complete sentence. */
