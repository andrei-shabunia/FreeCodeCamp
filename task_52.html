        // DESCRIPTION:
        /* The editor has two console.logs to help you see what is happening.
           Check the console as you code to see how it changes.
           Declare a local variable myVar inside myLocalScope and run the tests.
           Note: The console will still display ReferenceError: myVar is not defined, but this will not cause the tests to fail. */

        function myLocalScope() {
            // Only change code below this line
            var myVar = 10;
            console.log('inside myLocalScope', myVar);
        }

        myLocalScope();

        // Run and check the console
        // myVar is not defined outside of myLocalScope
        console.log('outside myLocalScope', myVar);
