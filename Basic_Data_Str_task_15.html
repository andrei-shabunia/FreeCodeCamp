        // Access Property Names with Bracket Notation

        // DESCRIPTION:
        /* This code will evaluate the value stored in the selectedFood variable and return the value of that key in the foods object,
           or undefined if it is not present. Bracket notation is very useful because sometimes object properties are not known before runtime
           or we need to access them in a more dynamic way.   */
