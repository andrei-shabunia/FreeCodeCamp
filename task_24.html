        // ESCAPING LITERAL QUOTES IN STRINGS

        // DESCRIPTION:
        // Use backslashes to assign a string to the myStr variable so that if you were to print it to the console, you would see:
        // I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes".

        const myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\"."; // Change this line
